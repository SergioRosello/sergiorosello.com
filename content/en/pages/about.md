I am a curious person, always trying to decipher the hidden message out of every situation. Good or bad.                                     

Until I went to college, I lived in a small town called Alcalalí, in Spain. Growing up in this environment has taught me more about life that I am able to express, but I will nevertheless try.

* Life is short
* There is good in everyone
* Nature is extraordinary
* One can learn something from anyone

Madrid has also taught me about personal identity, my passions, cultural events, and opportunities.
This is why I feel there is always something to be learned from anywhere you end up at.
